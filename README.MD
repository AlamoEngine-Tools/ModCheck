# Empire at War ModCheck

The ModCheck tool for Empire at War and Forces of Corruption allows mod makers
to check their mods for errors, like missing text entries, references or corrupted
models or map files.

The tool was originally developed by Mike Lankamp and is currently maintined by
the contributers to the Alamo Engine Tools GitHub organisation.
